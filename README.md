Mental health is vital for well-being, but many face barriers to care, such as stigma, high costs, and limited access to experts, especially in Singapore. These challenges often leave issues untreated. Sereni was created to overcome these obstacles and make mental health support more accessible for all.

Sereni's name is inspired by the word "serenity," reflecting its mission to offer calm and accessible mental health support. Just as "serenity" suggests peace and calmness, it aims to provide an open space for mental health care.

Sereni is a mental health platform designed to provide quick and reliable support to individuals facing mental health challenges. It offers a wealth of mental health resources available in Singapore, self-help tips, and access to professional guidance through a dedicated chatbot. Sereni is built to offer users a simple, anonymous, and cost-effective way to interact with mental health support, eliminating concerns of judgment or financial burden. The goal is to empower individuals to seek help and navigate their mental health journey with confidence and ease, knowing that support is just a click away.

I have developed Sereni with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website's front-end, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. Visual Studio Code was the development environment, with the Live Server extension for real-time hosting. Dialogflow was used to create the mental health chatbot, integrating it with webhooks and the Google Calendar API for appointment scheduling. Firebase was employed to store user data through the 'Contact Us' page, and the chatbot was connected to Telegram via the BotFather API, expanding accessibility across platforms.

Below you will find an over of the website implementation along with it's functions.
