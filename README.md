Sereni's name is inspired by the word "serenity," reflecting its mission to offer calm and accessible mental health support. Just as "serenity" suggests peace and calmness, it aims to provide an open space for mental health care.

Sereni is a mental health information and support website that includes a mental health chatbot and is intended to give swift support and information to those dealing with mental health issues. The platform provides users with a simple, anonymous, and cost-effective approach to interact with mental health support without fear of judgment or cost.
